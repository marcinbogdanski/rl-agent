# RL Agent

Mini Reinforcement Learning Library

## Short Info

This is a mini reinforcement learning repo implementing simple agent for OpenAI gym.

This is work in progress.

Currently includes:
 * very simple DQN implementation
 * linear function approximation with tiling features

## Alternatives

If you are looking for more mature RL codebase, here are few choices:
 * [OpenAI baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)
 * [Deepmind Lab](https://github.com/deepmind/lab)
 * [RLLab](https://github.com/rll/rllab)
 * [TensorForce](https://github.com/reinforceio/tensorforce/tree/master/tensorforce)
 * [keras-rl](https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl/tree/master/rl/agents)
