# RL Agent

Mini Reinforcement Learning Library

## Short Info

This is a mini reinforcement learning repo implementing simple agent for OpenAI gym.

This is work in progress.

Currently available agents:
*AgentQ* - e-greedy agent with q-function approximation
 * Algorithm - currenty *SARSA*, other to be added later (e.g. Monte-Carlo, Eligibility Traces, Q-Learning)
 * QFunction - pick from: *QFunctTabular*, *QFunctAggregate*, *QFunctTiles*
 * Policy - must be *PolicyEpsGreedy*

## Alternatives

If you are looking for more mature RL codebase, here are few choices:
